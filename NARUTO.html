            <h1>POWER AND SKILL</h1>
            <P>
                At the start of the series, Naruto is an energetic but relatively untalented ninja. However, he possesses an incredible reservoir of chakra (ninja energy) and a strong will. Over time, he trains diligently and learns various ninja techniques, including the Shadow Clone Jutsu and the Rasengan, a powerful and versatile attack. Later in the series, Naruto also forms a bond with the Nine-Tailed Fox (Kurama), allowing him access to its immense chakra.<br>
            </P><br>
            <h1>PERSONALITY</h1>
            <p>
                Naruto is known for his outgoing and boisterous personality. He has a strong sense of justice and a willingness to help others, even those who initially reject him. Despite facing adversity, Naruto remains optimistic and determined to achieve his goals. His catchphrase, "Believe it!" reflects his unwavering confidence in his abilities.<br>
            </p><br>
            <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
            <p>
                Naruto was born in the Hidden Leaf Village and faced a difficult childhood. He was orphaned at a young age after the Nine-Tailed Fox, a powerful tailed beast, attacked the village. The villagers, unaware that the fox was sealed within Naruto, treated him with disdain and avoided him. Despite his difficult circumstances, Naruto remained optimistic and developed a strong desire to gain recognition and become the Hokage.
